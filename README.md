# Import raw data to the system

This project englobes all the tools to import the different raw data from external sources to the Hbase system. 

The idea behind this import of raw data is to save the information with minimal changes and transformations, providing
permanent access to the raw data obtained from each source.

The following links will provide information of each data source import tool:
